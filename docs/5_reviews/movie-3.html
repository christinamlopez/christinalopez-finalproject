        <h2>The Hundred-Foot Journey</h2>
        

  
    
<p>The Hundred-Foot Journey tells the story of the Kadams, a family immigrating from India to France after they lost their restaurant and their mother/wife to a catastrophic fire. Papa, played by Om Puri, moves the family to the French countryside and decides to open a restaurant 100 feet away from a Michelin star restaurant run by Madame Mallory, played by Helen Mirren.</p>

  

  
    
<p>My parents took my sister and I to see this movie in theaters without telling us what movie we were watching or what it was about. I had never been more pleasantly surprised by a film. The colors, sound and story of “The Hundred-Foot Journey” makes for a perfect feel-good and easy watch. Lasse Hallström has a history of directing these feel-good and uplifting movies but we give this one 5 Michelin stars. Mirren delicately dances between a stuck-up restauranter and a kind hearted woman that reminds you of the positive impact of getting out of your comfort zone and being open to connecting with new types of people.</p>
