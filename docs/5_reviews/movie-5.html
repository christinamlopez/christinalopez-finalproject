        <h2>Just Go With It</h2>
        

  
    
<p>Our family are big Adam Sandler fans and “Just Go With It” is probably our collective favorite. My sister discovered this movie when she stayed home sick from elementary school and was trying to find something to watch. A few weeks later, my dad was in the living room, switching through channels on the TV when my sister said “Hey, Just Go With It! That’s a good movie,” which shocked my dad since he didn’t know how she had seen it in the first place. We finally watched it as a family and it quickly became part of our top favorite movies list.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Adam Sandler plays a plastic surgeon, who lies about being married/on the verge of divorce to sleep with women. Sandler meets a young woman, a teacher, who finds out his secret and leaves him. In order to get her back, Sandler creates an even bigger lie and ropes in his assistant, Jennifer Anniston, and her two children, to become his fake family as they go on a big family vacation in Hawaii.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler have such easy chemistry that when they have fun in the film, so do you.</p>
